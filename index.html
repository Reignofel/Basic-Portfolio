		<p>My name is Reiniel Jesus Florke, I was born and raised in Manhattan New York. I attended two prestigious boarding schools for middle and high school, Cardigan Mountain school and Mercersburg Academy respectively. My first job was at Armani Exchange when I was 16 years old. After that I went into the food industry working as a server and bartender. When I graduated from Mercersburg, I got into NYU for undergrad. I continued to work in various restaurants around the city until a friend recruited me to work in real estate at his start up company. I worked in real estate for a few years until I landed on my most recent job at Vitolite Electric in Port Chester NY. When I decided to move to California, My job asked me to stay on with them, so I VPN into work everyday from Los Angeles</p>
